# Project Name
Juicy Brickbreaker

# Context and date
10/11/2023

# Description
Tis the juiciest brickbreaker

## Implementation
Features:
- Screen Shake
- Changed colors
- Particles when the ball hits the paddle. (Tried to add particles for bricks but it would't work. Particles are purple because the ball is blue and paddles and bricks are red.)
- Changed the asset for the bricks. (Was going to do it for the rest of them but was scared it wasn't going to work and ruin the project)
- Sound effects for wall, paddle, and brick.(Made them myself)
- Music. (Not my own, couldn't get mine to loop. Tried really hard to get it to work)
- Bricks fall down when the level starts.
